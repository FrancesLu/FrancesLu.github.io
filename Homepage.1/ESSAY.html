        <p> Located between the convoluted roads of Asian cultures and suburban streets, lies Elmhurst, a community notorious for being a small town in the middle of Queens. It is a place that is often overlooked by foreigners who would get bored within seconds as they see the same pattern of houses aligned next to each other which was followed by the same marketing slogan of “一块钱水果” (1 dollar fruit), but the truth is, Elmhurst has become a haven for people to come together and create a community that merges the diverse cultural backgrounds. I remember I truly learned this when I first visited the Queens Center Mall (QCM). Since it first opened in 1973, the building has managed to transform from a stout beige building that would have a few customers into one that would modernize the city of Elmhurst, generating nearly 27 million annual visits. For many, it serves as a popular tourist attraction in Queens that is filled with an abundant amount of shops, but to me, it’s a place to take a step away from the things around me. It’s similar to when you find a box of old goods from your childhood, that feeling of familiarity mixed with a sense of comfort as you scramble around looking for your favorite childhood toy.  </p>
        <p> The beauty of the shop is that when someone walks in, they can find absolutely anything, whether they need to surprise their lover with a gift or if they need to grab a bite because they’re hungry, there will always be something. QCM embodies exploration into shops that you never even knew existed. It serves as a foundational structure for learning more about the inevitable progression of society, but most importantly, a second home to Elmhurst. See, my perception of this has managed to grow dramatically over the years. I no longer see it as just a place filled with chaotic children running around begging their parents to use the ice cream vending machine and I no longer see it as a place of a bunch of stores; instead, I see it as a place to just take a step back from reality and reflect. The beauty about the rooftop is that hardly anyone knows the secret. No one bothers climbing the dusty staircases and most people would not drive around in the circular tracks to get to the top. After all, it was always much easier to park on the first floor (plus you save gas). However, every time I’m up there, I always get to experience the wonders of seeing something that I haven’t seen before. It’s usually the tiniest details as well, such as the changing of the sky’s shape, the empty soda can that appeared next to the pole, the bird that suddenly perched in front of me, the engine sounds of the cars below us, and the list just goes on. It’s a place like any other, one where you could just simply admire from afar, the true beauty of the city. </p>
        <p> As the sunset took over the skies, the buildings were awashed by the lumination as they cast a symphony of colors through its faint glow. To your left, you see the tall billboards that loom over the city, advertising the most random things. I remember when I first went there, I would see the big “injured? Call 800-888-8888” which would instantly spark the joyous melody of “Don't wait, call 8!” To your right, you get to see the entirety of Elmhurst. While it might not be the most luxurious neighborhood, it’s a place filled with diverse cultures and a community unlike any other. This live-panoramic scenery brought a sense of comfort, one that allows an individual to ignore the state of utter bliss and stress that the world has brought upon them. It’s reminiscent of the times where you were just a carefree child, first learning about what the word “love” meant.  </p>
        <p> Who would’ve known that the simple graffiti of “love yourself” would help me get through some of my hard times in life. Who would’ve known that the wrongly placed brick would be symbolic of the times where I felt out of place. Who would’ve known that this rooftop was so much more than just a parking lot, it was a place of self-reflection through its serenity. Never underestimate the small things in life. The saying often goes “appreciate the things on the inside rather than the outside,” but to me, QCM managed to serve as a place of friendship, a place of comfort, and most importantly, a place to explore who I am as a person. So yes, while it may not be the luxurious rooftop that beams over NYC, it is a rooftop that allows me to beam over my life and help identify ways to constantly improve. </p>
